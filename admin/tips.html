                        <h4>Do your research.</h4>

                        <p><em>Source: MoneySmart website</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Before making any investment decision, research as much as possible. This will help you make informed decisions.</p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If you are thinking about investing in stocks, do your research on the companies you are interested in. Read the companies' financial statements
                            and talk to a financial advisor.
                        </p>

                        <br />
                        <h4>Stay away from risky investments.</h4>

                        <p><em>Source: Portuguese Securities Market Commission (CMVM) website</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> If you don't understand how an investment works, it's best to avoid it. Risky investments can lead to loss of money.</p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If you don't understand how the options market works, it's best to avoid investing in options. Options are a complex financial instrument that can
                            be very risky.
                        </p>

                        <br />
                        <h4>Protect yourself against risks.</h4>

                        <p>Buy health insurance, life insurance, and property insurance. This will help protect you and your family in case of unforeseen events.</p>

                        <br />
                        <h4>Read the fine print.</h4>

                        <p><em>Source: CMVM website</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Before investing in anything, make sure you understand the risks and rewards involved.</p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> When you open an investment account, you should carefully read the terms and conditions of the contract. These terms and conditions define your
                            rights and obligations as an investor.
                        </p>

                        <br />
                        <h4>Set financial goals.</h4>

                        <p>
                            What do you want to achieve with your investments? Do you want to retire early? Do you want to buy a house? Do you want to pay for your children's college? Having clear
                            goals will help you stay motivated.
                        </p>

                        <br />
                        <h4>Create a budget.</h4>

                        <p>This will help you track your income and expenses. Once you know where your money is going, you can start making cuts where possible.</p>

                        <br />
                        <h4>Pay off your debts first.</h4>

                        <p>Debt interest is one of the biggest financial costs you can have. Pay off your debts as quickly as possible to save money.</p>

                        <br />
                        <h4>Create an emergency fund.</h4>

                        <p>This is money you can use for unforeseen events, such as a broken car or a job loss. The recommendation is to have at least six months of monthly expenses saved.</p>

                        <br />
                        <h4>Live below your means.</h4>

                        <p>It's important to spend less than you earn. This will help you save money and achieve your financial goals.</p>

                        <br />
                        <h4>Start investing early.</h4>

                        <p><em>Source: Book "The Snowball: How to Get Rich in a Hurry" by Robert Kiyosaki</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Time is one of the most important factors in building wealth. The sooner you start investing, the more time your money will have to grow.</p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If you start investing 100 euros per month at age 25, you will have accumulated 100,000 euros by age 65, assuming a 7% annual return rate.
                            However, if you start investing at age 35, you will have accumulated only 50,000 euros by age 65.
                        </p>

                        <br />
                        <h4>Invest regularly.</h4>

                        <p><em>Source: Book "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham</em></p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Explanation:</strong> The power of time is even more powerful when you invest regularly. Even if you can only invest a small amount per month, it will make a big
                            difference over time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If you invest 100 euros per month for 30 years, you will have accumulated 100,000 euros, assuming a 7% annual return rate. However, if you invest
                            300 euros per month for 15 years, you will also have accumulated 100,000 euros.
                        </p>

                        <br />
                        <h4>Diversify your investments.</h4>

                        <p><em>Source: Book "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification helps reduce risk.</p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If you only invest in stocks, your portfolio will be subject to the fluctuations of the stock market. However, if you diversify your investments,
                            including stocks, bonds, and real estate, your portfolio will be more balanced and less subject to risk.
                        </p>

                        <br />
                        <h4>Be patient.</h4>

                        <p><em>Source: Book "The Snowball: How to Get Rich in a Hurry" by Robert Kiyosaki</em></p>

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Investments take time to grow. Don't expect to get rich overnight.</p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Example:</strong> If you invest 100 euros per month for 30 years, assuming a 7% annual return rate, you will have accumulated 100,000 euros. However, this will take
                            30 years.
